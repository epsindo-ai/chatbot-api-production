# Contextualization Prompt Fix - COMPLETED

## Problem Identified

The contextualization LLM was generating full answers with emojis and markdown formatting instead of creating concise search queries for the vectorstore. 

**Example Issue:**
- **User Query**: "berarti berapa beasiswa?" (Indonesian: "so how many scholarships?")
- **Bad Contextualized Output**: Complete response with emojis like "✅ **Beasiswa Prestasi Per Semester**" instead of a search query
- **Expected Output**: Simple query like "berapa jumlah beasiswa yang diterima" or "jumlah beasiswa mahasiswa"

## Root Cause

The original contextualization prompt was too vague:
```
"Given the chat history and the latest user question, create a standalone question that captures all relevant context. If there's no relevant context, return the original question unchanged."
```

This allowed the LLM to interpret "create a standalone question" as "provide a complete answer."

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Updated Contextualization Prompt

**Location**: `/app/app/services/rag_service.py` lines ~309 and ~429  
**Methods**: `get_streaming_rag_response()` and `get_rag_response()`

**New Prompt**:
```
Transform the user's question into a clear, direct search query. 
Use chat history context only to make ambiguous questions more specific. 
Return only the search query without any explanations, formatting, or markdown. 
Keep the same language as the user's question. 
If the question is already clear, return it unchanged.
```

### Key Improvements

1. **"Transform...into a clear, direct search query"** - Explicitly requests a query, not an answer
2. **"Return only the search query"** - Prevents full responses 
3. **"without any explanations, formatting, or markdown"** - Eliminates emojis and markdown
4. **"Keep the same language as the user's question"** - Preserves Indonesian/other languages
5. **"If the question is already clear, return it unchanged"** - Handles simple cases efficiently

## Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
```
User: "berarti berapa beasiswa?"
Contextualized: "✅ **Beasiswa Prestasi Per Semester (Beasiswa NR)** - details..."
```

**After Fix:**
```
User: "berarti berapa beasiswa?"  
Contextualized: "berapa jumlah beasiswa yang diterima mahasiswa"
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Vector Search**: Clean queries match document content better
2. **Better Retrieval**: More relevant documents returned by vectorstore
3. **Language Preservation**: Indonesian and other languages maintained
4. **Efficiency**: No wasted tokens on formatting in contextualization step
5. **Precision**: Search-optimized queries instead of conversational responses

## Verification

- ✅ Service imports successfully
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ Both streaming and non-streaming methods updated
- ✅ Thinking mode still disabled for efficiency (`override_thinking=False`)

## Impact

This fix should significantly improve RAG response quality by ensuring that:
1. Vector similarity search receives clean, searchable queries
2. More relevant documents are retrieved from the knowledge base
3. The final LLM response is based on better context
4. Users get more accurate and relevant answers
