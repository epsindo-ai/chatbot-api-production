# Contextualization Prompts Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ Code Cleanup
1. **Removed Legacy Methods**:
   - `create_rag_chain()` - Was only called by unused `get_conversation_chain()`
   - `get_conversation_chain()` - No references found in codebase

2. **Removed Unused Imports**:
   - `create_retrieval_chain` from `langchain.chains`
   - `create_history_aware_retriever` from `langchain.chains`

3. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - Now uses only 2 active methods: `get_streaming_rag_response()` and `get_rag_response()`
   - Single English contextualization prompt for consistency

### ✅ Documentation Updates
1. **Updated CONTEXTUALIZATION_PROMPTS_FLOW_GUIDE.md**:
   - Corrected from 2 prompts to 1 prompt
   - Removed legacy flow diagrams
   - Added cleanup benefits section
   - Updated line number references

2. **Updated COMPREHENSIVE_PROMPT_CATALOG.md**:
   - Corrected count from 20+ to 18+ prompts
   - Updated contextualization section 
   - Removed references to deleted methods
   - Added cleanup notes

## Current State

### Single Contextualization Prompt
**Location**: `/app/app/services/rag_service.py` lines 309-311 and 422-424
**Usage**: Both streaming and non-streaming RAG responses
**Language**: English

```
Given the chat history and the latest user question, create a standalone question that captures all relevant context. If there's no relevant context, return the original question unchanged.
```

### Active RAG Methods
1. **`get_streaming_rag_response()`**: Real-time streaming responses
2. **`get_rag_response()`**: Complete non-streaming responses
3. **`get_conversation_rag_response()`**: Dynamic collection-based responses

### Benefits
- ✅ **Consistency**: Single English prompt across all RAG operations
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Removed 68 lines of unused legacy code
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with fewer methods to maintain
- ✅ **Performance**: Eliminated unused imports and dead code paths

## Verification
- ✅ No compilation errors after cleanup
- ✅ API endpoints still reference active methods
- ✅ Documentation accurately reflects current implementation
- ✅ Line numbers updated to match current code structure

The codebase is now cleaner and uses a consistent approach for contextualization across all RAG operations.
